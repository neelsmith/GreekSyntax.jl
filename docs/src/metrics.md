## Verbal expressions

- span: distance from first to last token in group
- cohesion: proportion of tokens with span belonging to group 
- displacement: number of groups between start and end of span 

## Sentences

- maxdepth: maximum syntactic level of a sentence
- maxtokendistance
- avgtokendistance
